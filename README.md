# Cybersecurity Text Encryption Project

## Overview
This project is aimed at enhancing data protection through text encryption using various algorithms such as AES, DES, and RSA. The encryption process ensures secure transmission and storage of sensitive information, making it suitable for a wide range of applications requiring robust cybersecurity measures.

## Features
- **AES Encryption:** Implements Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm for secure encryption of text.
- **DES Encryption:** Utilizes Data Encryption Standard (DES) algorithm for text encryption.
- **RSA Encryption:** Implements Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) algorithm for asymmetric encryption.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository: `git clone [(https://github.com/abdulfaisal001/text_encryption).git]
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage
1. Run the `main.py` script.
2. Follow the on-screen instructions to select the encryption algorithm and input text for encryption.
3. Encrypted text will be generated and displayed.
